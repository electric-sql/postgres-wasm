Notes:

I was a able to run the code by checking out the previous commit
(e09661c) and following the instructions in README_WASM.md.

User command `make -f wasm/Makefile debug-build` and `make -f wasm/Makefile debug-datadir`.

Then start the http server from the wasm directory:

cd wasm
python3 -m http.server

and open the browser on the address served(I used Chrome).

You can communicate with Postgres using the console:

const event =  new CustomEvent("pg_wasm_query", 
  { "detail": { "query": "SELECT * FROM public.items;"}}); 

window.dispatchEvent(event);


PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
https://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at https://www.postgresql.org/.
